# Iftree: Include File Tree ðŸŒ³

Include many files in your Rust code for self-contained binaries.

![Test](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/iftree.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/iftree)

## Motivation

Self-contained binaries are easy to ship, as they come with any required file
data such as game assets, web templates, etc.

The standard library's `std::include_str!` includes the contents of a given
file. Iftree generalizes this in two ways:

- Not just one, but many files can be included at once with **path patterns** in
  a `.gitignore`-like format. Patterns are flexible: you can include multiple
  folders, skip hidden files, filter by filename extension, select a fixed file
  list, etc.
- Instead of including the file contents only, files can be associated with
  **any data** fields such as additional file metadata.

Conceptually:

```text
std:       include_str!("my_file")
Iftree:    any_macro!("my_files/**")
```

Refer to [**related work**](#related-work) to see Iftree in the context of
other, similar projects.

## Introduction

Here is a minimal example that shows the basic functionality.

```rust
// Say you have the following files:
//
//     my_assets/
//     â”œâ”€â”€ file_a
//     â”œâ”€â”€ file_b
//     â””â”€â”€ folder/
//         â””â”€â”€ file_c

// To include these files in your code, the macro `iftree::include_file_tree` is
// attached to a custom type like this:
#[iftree::include_file_tree("paths = '/my_assets/**'")]
pub struct MyAsset {
    contents_str: &'static str,
}
// Above we configure a path pattern to filter the files in `my_assets/` and its
// subfolders. For each selected file, an instance of `MyAsset` is initialized.
// The standard field `contents_str` is automatically populated with a call to
// `include_str!`, but you can plug in your own initializer.

fn main() {
    // Based on this, Iftree generates an array `ASSETS` with the desired file
    // data. You can use it like so:
    assert_eq!(ASSETS.len(), 3);
    assert_eq!(ASSETS[0].contents_str, "â€¦ contents file_a\n");
    assert_eq!(ASSETS[1].contents_str, "â€¦ contents file_b\n");
    assert_eq!(ASSETS[2].contents_str, "â€¦ file_c\n");

    // Also, variables `base::x::y::MY_FILE` are generated (named by file path):
    assert_eq!(base::my_assets::FILE_A.contents_str, "â€¦ contents file_a\n");
    assert_eq!(base::my_assets::FILE_B.contents_str, "â€¦ contents file_b\n");
    assert_eq!(base::my_assets::folder::FILE_C.contents_str, "â€¦ file_c\n");
}
```

## Usage

Now that you have a general idea of the library, learn how to integrate it with
your project.

### Getting started

1. Add the **dependency** `iftree = "0.1"` to your manifest (`Cargo.toml`).

1. Define your **asset type** (`MyAsset` in the [introduction](#introduction)).

   This is a `struct` with the fields you need per file. Alternatively, it can
   be a type alias, which may be convenient if you have exactly one field.

1. Next, **filter files** to be included by annotating your asset type with
   `#[iftree::include_file_tree("paths = '/my/assets/**'")]`.

   The macro argument is a [TOML](https://toml.io) string literal. Its `paths`
   option here supports `.gitignore`-like path patterns, with one pattern per
   line. These paths are relative to the folder with your manifest by default.
   See the [`paths` configuration](#paths) for more.

1. When building your project, code is generated that uses an **initializer** to
   instantiate the asset type once per file.

   By default, a field `contents_str` (if any) is populated with `include_str!`,
   a field `contents_bytes` is populated with `include_bytes!`, and a couple of
   other [standard fields](#standard-fields) are recognized. However, you can
   plug in your own macro to fully customize the initialization by
   [configuring an initializer](#templateinitializer). For even more control
   over code generation, there is the concept of [visitors](#template-visitors).

1. Now you can **access** your included file data via `ASSETS` array or via
   `base::my::assets::MY_FILE` variables.

### Examples

If you like to explore by example, there is an
[**`examples` folder**](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/tree/main/examples).
The documentation links to individual examples where helpful.

You could get started with the
[introductory example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/basic.rs).
For a more complex case, see the
[showcase example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/showcase.rs).

Note that some examples need extra dependencies from the `dev-dependencies` of
the [manifest](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/tree/main/Cargo.toml).

### Standard fields

When you use a subset of the following fields only, an initializer for your
asset type is generated without further configuration. You can still override
these field names with a [custom initializer](#templateinitializer).

- **`contents_bytes:`** `&'static [u8]`

  File contents as a byte array, using
  [`std::include_bytes`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html).

- **`contents_str:`** `&'static str`

  File contents interpreted as a UTF-8 string, using
  [`std::include_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html).

- **`get_bytes:`** `fn() -> std::borrow::Cow<'static, [u8]>`

  In debug builds (that is, when
  [`debug_assertions`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#debug_assertions)
  is enabled), this function reads the file afresh on each call at runtime. It
  panics if there is any error such as if the file does not exist. This helps
  with faster development, as it avoids rebuilding if asset file contents are
  changed only (note that you still need to rebuild if assets are added,
  renamed, or removed).

  In release builds, it returns the file contents included at compile time,
  using
  [`std::include_bytes`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html).

- **`get_str:`** `fn() -> std::borrow::Cow<'static, str>`

  Same as `get_bytes` but for the file contents interpreted as a UTF-8 string,
  using
  [`std::include_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html).

- **`relative_path:`** `&'static str`

  File path relative to the base folder, which is the folder with your manifest
  (`Cargo.toml`) by default. Path components are separated by a slash `/`,
  independent of your platform.

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/basics_standard_fields.rs).

### Name sanitization

When generating identifiers based on paths, names are sanitized. For example, a
filename `.my-env` is sanitized to an identifier `_MY_ENV`.

The sanitization process is designed to generate valid
[Unicode identifiers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/identifiers.html).
Essentially, it replaces invalid identifier characters by underscores `"_"`.

More precisely, these transformations are applied in order:

1. The case of letters is adjusted to respect naming conventions:
   - All lowercase for folders (because they map to module names).
   - All uppercase for filenames (because they map to static variables).
1. Characters without the property `XID_Continue` are replaced by `"_"`. The set
   of `XID_Continue` characters in ASCII is `[0-9A-Z_a-z]`.
1. If the first character does not belong to `XID_Start` and is not `"_"`, then
   `"_"` is prepended. The set of `XID_Start` characters in ASCII is `[A-Za-z]`.
1. If the name is `"_"`, `"crate"`, `"self"`, `"Self"`, or `"super"`, then `"_"`
   is appended.

Note that non-ASCII identifiers are only supported from Rust 1.53.0. For earlier
versions, the sanitization here may generate invalid identifiers if you use
non-ASCII paths, in which case you need to manually rename any affected files.

### Portable file paths

To prevent issues when developing on different platforms, your file paths should
follow these recommendations:

- Path components are separated by a slash `/` (even on Windows).
- Filenames do not contain backslashes `\` (even on Unix-like systems).

### Troubleshooting

To inspect the generated code, there is a [`debug` configuration](#debug).

## Recipes

Here are example solutions for given problems.

### Kinds of asset types

- [Type alias](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/basics_type_alias.rs)

  (`struct` with named fields)
- [Tuple struct](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/basics_type_tuple_fields.rs)
  (`struct` with unnamed fields)
- [Unit-like struct](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/basics_type_unit.rs)
  (`struct` without field list)

case: including files from a folder filtered by filename extension. The project
has since developed into something more flexible.

## Configuration reference

The `iftree::include_file_tree` macro is configured via a
[TOML](https://toml.io) string with the following fields.

### `base_folder`

Path patterns are interpreted as relative to this folder.

If this path itself is relative, then it is joined to the folder given by the
environment variable `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`. That is, a relative path `x/y/z` has
a full path `[CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR]/[base_folder]/x/y/z`.

**Default:** `""`

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_base_folder.rs).

### `debug`

Whether to generate a string variable `DEBUG` with debug information such as the
generated code.

**Default:** `false`

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_debug.rs).

### `paths`

A string with a path pattern per line to filter files.

It works like a `.gitignore` file with inverted meaning:

- If the last matching pattern is negated (with `!`), the file is excluded.
- If the last matching pattern is not negated, the file is included.
- If no pattern matches, the file is excluded.

The pattern language is as documented in the
[`.gitignore` reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), with this
difference: you must use `x/y/*` instead of `x/y/` to include files in a folder
`x/y/`; to also include subfolders (recursively), use `x/y/**`.

Exclude hidden files with `!.*` as a pattern. Another common pattern is of the
form `*.xyz` to include files with filename extension `xyz` only.

By default, path patterns are relative to the environment variable
`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, which is the folder with your manifest (`Cargo.toml`). See
the [`base_folder` configuration](#base_folder) to customize this.

This is a **required** option without default.

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_paths.rs).

### `root_folder_variable`

The name of the environment variable to use as the root folder for the
[`base_folder` configuration](#base_folder).

The value of the environment variable should be an absolute path.

**Default:** `"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"`

### `template.identifiers`

Whether to generate an identifier per file.

Given a file `x/y/my_file`, a `static` variable `base::x::y::MY_FILE` is
generated, nested in modules for folders. Their root module is `base`, which
represents the base folder.

Each variable is a reference to the corresponding element in the `ASSETS` array.

Generated identifiers are subject to [name sanitization](#name-sanitization).
Because of this, there may be collisions in the generated code, causing an error
about a name being defined multiple times. The code generation does not try to
resolve such collisions automatically, as this would likely cause confusion
about which identifier refers to which file. Instead, you need to manually
rename any affected paths (assuming you need the generated identifiers at all â€“
otherwise, you can just disable this with `template.identifiers = false`).

**Default:** `true`

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_template_identifiers.rs).

### `template.initializer`

A macro name used to instantiate the asset type per file.

As inputs, the macro is passed the following arguments, separated by comma:

1. Relative file path as a string literal.
1. Absolute file path as a string literal.

As an output, the macro must return a
[constant expression](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html#constant-expressions).

**Default:** A default initializer is constructed by recognizing
[standard fields](#standard-fields).

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_template_initializer.rs).

### `template` visitors

This is the most flexible customization of the code generation process.

Essentially, a visitor transforms the tree of selected files into code. It does
so by calling custom macros at these levels:

- For the base folder, a `visit_base` macro is called to wrap everything (top
  level).
- For each folder, a `visit_folder` macro is called, wrapping the code generated
  from its files and subfolders (recursively).
- For each file, a `visit_file` macro is called (bottom level).

These macros are passed the following inputs, separated by comma:

- `visit_base`:
  1. Total number of selected files as a `usize` literal.
  1. Outputs of the visitor applied to the base folder entries.
- `visit_folder`:
  1. Folder name as a string literal.
  1. [Sanitized](#name-sanitization) folder name as an identifier.
  1. Outputs of the visitor applied to the folder entries.
- `visit_file`:
  1. Filename as a string literal.
  1. [Sanitized](#name-sanitization) filename as an identifier.
  1. Zero-based index of the file among the selected files as a `usize` literal.
  1. Relative file path as a string literal.
  1. Absolute file path as a string literal.

The `visit_folder` macro is optional. If missing, the outputs of the
`visit_file` calls are directly passed as an input to the `visit_base` call.
This is useful to generate flat structures such as arrays. Similarly, the
`visit_base` macro is optional.

You can configure multiple visitors. They are applied in order.

To plug in visitors, add this to your configuration for each visitor:

```toml
[[template]]
visit_base = 'visit_my_base'
visit_folder = 'visit_my_folder'
visit_file = 'visit_my_file'

```

`visit_my_â€¦` are the names of your corresponding macros.
