# Iftree: Include File Tree ðŸŒ³

Include file data from many files in your Rust code for self-contained binaries.

## Motivation

Self-contained binaries are easy to ship, as they come with any required file
data such as game assets, web templates, etc.

The standard library's `std::include_str!` includes the contents of a given
file. Iftree generalizes this in two ways:

1. Not just one, but many files can be included at once with **path patterns**
   in a `.gitignore`-like format.
1. Instead of including the file contents only, files can be associated with
   **any data** such as their media type, a compiled template, etc.

Conceptually:

```text
std:       include_str!("my_file")
Iftree:    any_macro!("my_files/**")
```

## Introduction

The basic functionality is simple. Say you have the following files:

```text
my_assets/
- file_a
- file_b
- subfolder/
  - file_c
```

To include these files in your code, the macro `iftree::include_file_tree` is
attached to a custom type like so:

```rust
#[iftree::include_file_tree("paths = '/my_assets/**'")]
pub struct MyAsset {
    contents_str: &'static str,
}
```

Here we configure a path pattern to filter the files in `my_assets/` and its
subfolders. For each selected file, an instance of `MyAsset` is initialized. The
standard field `contents_str` is automatically populated with a call to
`include_str!`, but you can plug in your own initializer.

Based on this, Iftree generates an array `ASSETS` with the desired file data.
You can use it like this:

```rust
assert_eq!(ASSETS.len(), 3);
assert_eq!(ASSETS[0].contents_str, "â€¦ contents `file_a`\n");
assert_eq!(ASSETS[1].contents_str, "â€¦ contents `file_b`\n");
assert_eq!(ASSETS[2].contents_str, "â€¦ and `file_c`\n");
```

Furthermore, variables `base::x::y::MY_FILE` are generated (named by file path):

```rust
assert_eq!(base::my_assets::FILE_A.contents_str, "â€¦ contents `file_a`\n");
assert_eq!(base::my_assets::FILE_B.contents_str, "â€¦ contents `file_b`\n");
assert_eq!(base::my_assets::subfolder::FILE_C.contents_str, "â€¦ and `file_c`\n");
```

## Usage

Now that you have a general idea of the library, learn how to integrate it with
your project.

By the way, there is an
[**`examples` folder**](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/tree/main/examples)
if you like to explore by example.

### Getting started

1. Add the dependency `iftree = "0.1"` to your manifest (`Cargo.toml`).
1. Define your **asset type.** This is a `struct` with the fields you need per
   file (`MyAsset` in the [introduction](#introduction)). Alternatively, it can
   be a type alias, which may be convenient if you have a exactly one field.
1. Next, **filter files** to be included by annotating your asset type with
   `#[iftree::include_file_tree("paths = 'â€¦'")]`. Path patterns in a
   `.gitignore`-like format are supported, with one pattern per line. The paths
   are relative to the folder with your manifest by default. Patterns are
   flexible: you can skip hidden files, filter by filename extension, add
   multiple folders, select a fixed list of files, etc. See the
   [`paths` configuration](#paths) for more.
1. The generated code then uses an **initializer** to instantiate the asset type
   once per file. By default, a field `contents_str` (if any) is populated with
   `include_str!`, a field `contents_bytes` is populated with `include_bytes!`,
   and a couple of other [standard fields](#standard-fields) are recognized.
   However, you can plug in your own macro to fully customize the initialization
   by [configuring an `initializer`](#initializer).

The
[showcase example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/showcase.rs)
combines these things.

### Standard fields

When you use fields from the following list only, an initializer for your asset
type is generated without further configuration. You can still override these
field names with a [custom `initializer`](#initializer).

- **`contents_bytes:`** `&'static [u8]`

  File contents as a byte array, using
  [`std::include_bytes`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html).

- **`contents_str:`** `&'static str`

  File contents interpreted as a UTF-8 string, using
  [`std::include_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html).

- **`get_bytes:`** `fn() -> std::borrow::Cow<'static, [u8]>`

  In debug builds (that is, when
  [`debug_assertions`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#debug_assertions)
  is enabled), this function reads the file afresh on each call at runtime. It
  panics if there is any error such as if the file does not exist. This helps
  with faster development, as it avoids rebuilding if asset file contents are
  changed only (note that you still need to rebuild if assets are added,
  renamed, or removed).

  In release builds, it returns the file contents included at compile time,
  using
  [`std::include_bytes`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html).

- **`get_str:`** `fn() -> std::borrow::Cow<'static, str>`

  Same as `get_bytes` but for the file contents interpreted as a UTF-8 string,
  using
  [`std::include_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html).

- **`relative_path:`** `&'static str`

  File path relative to the base folder, which is the folder with your manifest
  (`Cargo.toml`) by default.

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/basics_standard_fields.rs).

### Troubleshooting

To inspect the generated code, there is a [`debug` configuration](#debug).

## Configuration

The `iftree::include_file_tree` macro is configured via a
[TOML](https://toml.io) string with the following fields.

### `paths`

A string with a path pattern per line to filter files.

It works like a `.gitignore` file with inverted meaning:

- If the last matching pattern is negated (with `!`), the file is excluded.
- If the last matching pattern is not negated, the file is included.
- If no pattern matches, the file is excluded.

Note that to you must use `a/b/*` instead of `a/b/` to include files in a folder
`a/b/`. To also include subfolders (recursively), use `a/b/**`.

See the [`.gitignore` reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) for more.

By default, path patterns are relative to the environment variable
`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, which is the folder with your manifest (`Cargo.toml`). See
the [`base_folder` configuration](#base_folder) to customize this.

To avoid path issues when developing on different platforms, follow these
recommendations:

- Always use a slash `/` as a folder separator (even on Windows).
- Never use backslashes `\` in filenames (even on Linux).

This is a **required** option without default.

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_paths.rs).

### `base_folder`

Path patterns are interpreted as relative to this folder.

If this path itself is relative, then it is joined to the folder given by the
environment variable `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`. That is, a relative path `a/b/c` has
a full path `[CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR]/[base_folder]/a/b/c`.

**Default:** `""`

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_base_folder.rs).

### `root_folder_variable`

The name of the environment variable to use as the root folder for the
[`base_folder` configuration](#base_folder).

This should be an absolute path.

**Default:** `"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"`

### `initializer`

A macro name used to instantiate the asset type per file.

As an input, the macro is passed the following arguments, separated by comma:

1. Relative file path as a string literal.
2. Absolute file path as a string literal.

As an output, the macro must return a
[constant expression](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html#constant-expressions).

**Default:** A default initializer is constructed by recognizing
[standard fields](#standard-fields).

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_initializer.rs).

### `identifiers`

Whether to generate an identifier per file.

Given a file `a/b/my_file`, a `static` variable `base::a::b::MY_FILE` is
generated, nested in modules for folders. Their root module is `base`, which
represents the base folder.

Each variable is a reference to the corresponding element in the `ASSETS` array.

Path names are sanitized as follows to ensure they are
[valid identifiers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/identifiers.html):

- Characters other than ASCII alphanumericals are replaced by `"_"`.
- If the first character is numeric, then `"_"` is prepended.
- If the transformed name is `"_"`, `"crate"`, `"self"`, `"Self"`, or `"super"`,
  then `"_"` is appended.

Furthermore, the name is adjusted to respect these conventions:

- Lowercase for module names (corresponding to folders).
- Uppercase for static variable names (corresponding to files).

**Default:** `true`

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_identifiers.rs).

### `debug`

Whether to generate an identifier `DEBUG` with debug information such as the
generated code.

**Default:** `false`

See
[example](https://github.com/evolutics/iftree/blob/main/examples/configuration_debug.rs).

## Recipes
